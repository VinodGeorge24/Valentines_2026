1. Core User Experience
Initial Screen

Display centered text:
“Marlene, would you be my valentine?”

Below the text, show two buttons:

Yes

No

The page should be clean, centered, and mobile-friendly.

2. Button Logic
Yes Button

Clicking Yes at any time should replace the entire screen with this message (formatted cleanly, centered):

Great choice! Look forward to:

Date at I Gemelli  
Outfit: Something FORMAL!  
Time: 5 PM date, be ready before!  
What to Bring: just yo ahh :)

THANK YOU SOOO MUCH <3


When Yes is clicked:

Clear localStorage so that refreshing or reopening the page resets the experience back to the beginning.

No Button

Each time No is clicked:

Increase the size of the Yes button by 1.25x

Re-render the same screen

Save the number of No clicks to localStorage

The Yes button scaling should follow this formula:

scale = 1.25 ^ noClickCount

The No button can stay the same size.

3. Maximum No Click Behavior

After 5 No clicks:

The page text should change to:

“MARLENE BE MY VALENTINE!”

The No button should be removed

Only the enlarged Yes button remains

The Yes button should remain scaled up by 1.25x for each No click (5 total times).

4. Persistence (localStorage)

Store noClickCount in localStorage

On page load:

Read noClickCount

Apply correct Yes button size

Show or hide No button accordingly

Show correct text based on count:

0–4 No clicks:
“Marlene, would you be my valentine?”

5+ No clicks:
“MARLENE BE MY VALENTINE!”

Cap noClickCount at 5 (do not allow further growth beyond 5)

5. Technical Requirements

Output should be a single HTML file:

Inline CSS

Inline JavaScript

No external libraries

Clean, readable code

Works on mobile and desktop

Center content vertically and horizontally

Buttons should have smooth scale animation when resizing (CSS transition)

6. File Output

Cursor should output:

index.html

Containing:

HTML structure

Embedded <style> for layout + buttons

Embedded <script> for logic + localStorage

7. UI Style (Light Guidance)

Soft, cute vibe

Large readable text

Rounded buttons

Slight hover effect on buttons

No complicated visuals

8. Success Criteria

Refreshing the page preserves progress until Yes is clicked

After Yes is clicked, refresh resets to original state

After 5 No clicks, No button disappears and text changes

Yes button grows correctly each time

No errors in console

Works by simply opening the HTML file in a browser

9. Final Instruction to Agent

Generate the complete working index.html file that fulfills all requirements above. Do not include explanations. Only output the final HTML file content
